<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally got it!! Since it was released, I dream of it! What? the MegaCD1 
  !!!<br>
  A CD drive for the Sega Megadrive/Genesis</p>
<p>It's a japanese version, it's like new from the outside (and from the inside 
  too!)<br>
  But that dream soon became a nightmare!<br>

<p>What the....??!<br>
  &quot;Disk check&quot; and the red light who blinks...<br>
  Nothing else...<br>
  I press pad...nothing<br>
  I reset...nothing<br>
  I switch off/on...nothing<br>
  What ever i do, nothing else than MegaCD logo animation and music</p>
<p><b>11:20 AM</b></p>
<p>Internet...the world who always save me!<br>
  I read the SX forum...I found common problems diagnostics<br>
  - Bad adaptator (I try original 110V, i try Genny one, i try another Sega...nothing)<br>
  - Fuse (not the problem...MegaCD power on)<br>
  - Bad CD...perhaps a bad CD inside ? does it mean I need to open it ?!</p>
<p><b>11:45 AM</b></p>
<p>My girlfriend call me!<br>
  The tray is open! then it close itself...to open again...and close...<br>
  &quot;Why the red light blink?&quot; ask my girl friend....If I knew....</p>
<p><b>12:00 AM</b></p>
<p>PowerOFF<br>
  I move the MegaCD...there is a strange noise inside...bad!<br>
  PowerON<br>
  The tray now open and close without end<br>
  Time to eat and think about it...<br>
  We're sunday, I have something else to do :)</p>
<p><b>05:30 PM</b></p>
<p>No way..I have to open it....<br>
  I'm afraid...I don't like it, specially laser stuff....and I'm not a super electronician<br>
  My digital camera's battery is full...let's take some pictures while I'm in...</p>
<p>First, I remove the 2 blacks screws near the Genny connector</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00881.JPG" width="384" height="288"><img src="img/MCD/DSC00884.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then the 6 golden screws at the rear of the MegaCD</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00882.JPG" width="384" height="288"><img src="img/MCD/DSC00883.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a little hard to open but when you understood, it's ok...<br>
  Play a little with the Genny connector and be sure the Lock (at the right) is 
  closed (it's easier like this)</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00885.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remove the metal (shield?) protection and now look at the CD Drive</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00886.JPG" width="384" height="288"><img src="img/MCD/DSC00887.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The loading drawer is closed<br>
  I remove the clamper (?)</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00888.JPG" width="384" height="288"><img src="img/MCD/DSC00889.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strange....the optical block isn't aligned...<br>
  I remove the 4 black screws aroung the CD Driver to release it</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00890.JPG" width="384" height="288"><img src="img/MCD/DSC00891.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The optical block is REALLY bad aligned!<br>
  What the hell made this ?</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00892.JPG" width="384" height="288"><img src="img/MCD/DSC00893.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>07:00 PM</b></p>
<p>The MegaCD is opened...CD Drive is out...I'm looking at it...<br>
  What the....! a broken part!</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00896.JPG" width="384" height="288"><img src="img/MCD/DSC00895.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>Between the 2 switches, there is a platic leg...who is broken!<br>
  The PCB where all of this is soldered is so too much down. If you look at the 
  pictures, you'll (perhaps) see the PCB isn't parallel to the CD Drive<br>
  I put the switches back in their holes, remount all and try...<br>
  PowerON!<br>
  Same thing....<br>
  &quot;But why the red light blink?&quot; ask my girl friend....again</p>
<p><b>08:00 PM</b></p>
<p>The MegaCD is open...again<br>
  The 2 switchs are again out of their holes, the PCB and the optical block still 
  too down...<br>
  I put plastic bubbles to be sure the PCB won't go down again</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00908.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>The CDDrive is back in the MegaCD, the broken part can't move because on this 
  plastic bubbles...</p>
<p>Remount all...<br>
  Ohoh!!! Change!<br>
  <img src="img/MCD/DSC00904.JPG" width="384" height="288"> <img src="img/MCD/DSC00905.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>I now can press Start to access the menu<br>
  Open / Close with this menu works<br>
  I saw the RAM (hmm...Lunar saves)<br>
  I put a CD....<br>
  Nothing...ARGGGGGGGG</p>
<p>&quot;But why the red light blink?&quot; ask my girl friend....<br>
  &quot;Because...&quot; Wait....there is something written under the lights!!!</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00880.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>Green + Red light on = CD Access<br>
  Green light on only = CD In<br>
  Green on + Red blinking = CD Out &lt;=== WHAT THE ?!!!<br>
  Green blinking only = Stand by</p>
<p>So it's that !!! The MegaCD always think the CD Drive is open<br>
  But why Open / Close works on the menu ?!<br>
  <br>
  Time to eat...I need food and water!</p>
<p><b>09:00 PM</b></p>
<p>Fonzie is on MSN<br>
  I explain him what is going on...</p>
<p>I look further this CD In / CD Out problem...<br>
  I open the MegaCD with tray open</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC00902.JPG" width="384" height="288"><img src="img/MCD/DSC00903.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>Strange...the optical block is aligned and down (normal)<br>
  I saw (not on the picture) a switch is pressed with a plastic stuff at the end 
  of the tray</p>
<p>I look the connector of these switches </p>
<p>1. LO<br>
  2. LO<br>
  3. Out<br>
  4. Gnd<br>
  5. In</p>
<p>So it's that....these 2 switches are here to tell the MegaCD if the tray is 
  open or close (In or Out)<br>
  I remount all and try....nothing better</p>
<p><b>10:00 PM</b></p>
<p>Fonzie explain me how a CD Drive work :<br>
  The tray close and the spindle table (optical block) goes up , the CD is then 
  on the spindle</p>
<p>So why the spindle table doesn't go up but, worst, go down left!<br>
  It is attached to a black thing...with something like white oil...<br>
  From the bottom, I can use a screwdriver and rotate it.....the spindle table 
  goes up!!!<br>
  It is now at the right place, the cramper fit (with its magnet) to the spindle</p>
<p>Of course...I never noticed but, if you understand how a CD drive works, you 
  must have<br>
  - the spindle table up and &quot;glued&quot; to the cramper (to be sure the 
  CD won't move) when the tray is closed<br>
  - the spindle table down (to let the CD go with the tray) when the tray is opened</p>
<p>I remount all, all is like it must be!<br>
  Power ON<br>
  Samething on the red light...<br>
  Why ?!!!!<br>
  The MegaCD is still thinking the tray is open....<br>
</p>
<p>I open the MegaCD...optical block is down...again...</p>
<p>Sleep...It's now all I want....my bed...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i><font size="4">Monday, 6th September 2004</font></i></b></p>
<p><b>06:00 AM</b></p>
<p>....the only thing i found broken is this plastic leg near the CD In/Out switched<br>
  ....the MegaCD always think the tray is open ...which mean, always think CD 
  Out<br>
  ...I saw, with the tray open, the CD Out switch worked</p>
<p>The CD In switch!!!!!<br>
  I'm sure all is near these 2 switches!</p>
<p>I need to find <br>
  - the default optical block position (i'm pretty it's like then I put it up, 
  tray closed)<br>
  - the default states of the switches....CD Out, i think it's ok...but does it 
  mean the CD In must be in ON way ? How ? I don't see nothing on the hole....</p>
<p>Well...I'll test it later</p>
<p><b>01:00 PM</b></p>
<p>Time to share my currently state with the world....</p>
</p>
<p><b><i><font size="4">Sunday, 17th October 2004</font></i></b></p>
<p><b>01:00 PM</b></p>
<p>This time, I'll got it!<br>
  I open it again and manage to open the tray while working with the bad aligned block.<br>
  <img src="img/MCD/DSC01498.JPG" width="384" height="288"> </p>
<p>The block could go down and up because, at the rear, it is in two &quot;U&quot;. What to do think I found ? Yes...the left is broken!<br>
  So when the block go down, nothing keep it aligned and so it turn a little to the right, when it go out of its left &quot;U&quot;</p>
<p>As I can't change the broken &quot;U&quot;, I think I must put reversed &quot;U&quot;.<br>
  My girlfriend (this time, I ask her when I got a problem) told me &quot;a pen hat?&quot; No, but it gives me the solution : a pen</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC01500.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>I cut a litlle part and make it as a &quot;U&quot; then put it on the block like this : </p>
<p> <img src="img/MCD/DSC01501.JPG" width="384" height="288"> <img src="img/MCD/DSC01502.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, now the bad aligned block is corrected!<br>
Let see this CD In switch. </p>
<p>Playing with the CD Tray, I found that when it's open, the block move a little.<br>
  So the open/close tray has an impact on the block.</p>
<p>After some hours, I found that the wheels which control the open/tray weren't at the good angle.<br>
Now it's ok, the CD In is activated!</p>
<p>How does it work ?<br>
  When the MegaCD opens the tray, it first makes the block  down.<br>
  When it closes the tray, at the end, it makes the block up and when the block is up, the CD In switch is activated.<br>
  Here is a little video showing this : <a href="img/MCD/MOV01503_d.mpg" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
<p>I mount all and try...nothing!<br>
  I re-open it and found the CD In again in the wrong position....Again, it's because the part where it is is broken.<br>
  I remove the lights protection to see how all work when it's power on.<br>
</p>
<p><b>05:00 PM</b></p>
<p>I found the wheels were again at the wrong angle!<br>
Let's test again now</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC01508.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>The red light doesn't blink!<br>
  I put an audio cd</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC01507.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>Yes! I can listen to Jamiroquai!!!!!!</p>
<p>I put a game.<br>
  Nothing.</p>
<p>Wait! It's perhaps the game!! I want to believe!<br>
I put Wonderdog in it</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC01509.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!<br>
  Wow! What an ugly game!<br>
  Hurry, put Silpheed!</p>
<p><img src="img/MCD/DSC01510.JPG" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>and so...? It hangs....</p>
<p>I make several tests with differents games...The CD works, doesn't work, only play audio....<br>
  It's seems I have some others problems!!!</p>
<p>This time, I think it's a common one : ugly lens. Since I opened it and worked on it a lot, I think the lens got some dust. </p>
<p>Ok, I'll finish all of this later. The main problem is for me corrected and it's enought for today!!!</p>

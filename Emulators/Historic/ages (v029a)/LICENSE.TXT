Notes about Distributing AGES
-----------------------------
You may redistribute this emulator if and only if you follow these rules:

1. The archive must be unchanged.  Nothing should be added, nothing should
   be removed.  (This means no lame "This was downloaded from ___" files,
   and absolutely no ROMs.)
2. You must not make profit in any way from distributing my emulator.  (That
   means it absolutely must not appear in a commercially distributed
   "collection" of any kind.)
3. You must not take credit for my work.
4. You must not violate my copyright in any other way that I haven't
   explicitly stated.
